# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Visual-Recognition-CS231n
This repository contains my solutions (on Python3 Jupyter notebook) to the assignments of the CS231n course offered by Stanford University.

Find course notes and assignments [here](http://cs231n.github.io/)

Assignment solutions are given below.

| **Assignment 1** | **Description** |
